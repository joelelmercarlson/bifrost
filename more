While constructing the BuildPlan the following exceptions were encountered:

--  While attempting to add dependency,
    Could not find package GLFW-b in known packages

--  While attempting to add dependency,
    Could not find package GLUtil in known packages

--  While attempting to add dependency,
    Could not find package OpenGL in known packages

--  Failure when adding dependencies:    
      GLFW-b: needed (-any), not present in build plan (latest is 1.4.7.3)
      GLUtil: needed (-any), not present in build plan (latest is 0.8.7)
      OpenGL: needed (-any), not present in build plan (latest is 2.13.1.0)
    needed for package: bifrost-0.1.0.0

Recommended action: try adding the following to your extra-deps in /home/loki/bifrost/stack.yaml
- GLFW-b-1.4.7.3
- GLUtil-0.8.7
- OpenGL-2.13.1.0
